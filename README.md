It is possible to mount 2 PCB's in one box as top and bottom shell have identical mounting pattern

PCB contains:
* ESP32 WROVER module
* CH340G (with a crystal) or CH340C (without) USB-serial interface
* 5.5mm jack plug
* USB-mini plug
* up to 4 buck-convertor modules (MP1584EN based)
* 3.3V LDO regulator (AM1117-3.3)
* supporting capacitors (22p, 100n, 1u, 10u)
* Space for 15 1206 SMD passives
* Space for several 1.27mm pitch narrow/wide body SO IC's with up to 40 pins
* Space for 2.54mm pitch components - round pads connected horizontally in groups of 5
* 2.54mm pitch Bus bar - with square pads
* space for two L298N dual full H bridge driver IC's
